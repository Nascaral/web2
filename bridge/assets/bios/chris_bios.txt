Chris Tao is the COO and co-founder of Bridge, a financial technology company focused on giving everyday people access to the kinds of tools and clarity traditionally reserved for institutions and the wealthy. With over four years of experience as a Research Associate in the biotech industry, Chris brings a rigorous, data-driven mindset to product design—one shaped by precision, validation, and an unwavering responsibility to real people impacted by the work.
Before founding Bridge, Chris worked hands-on in laboratory and clinical environments supporting research tied to patient outcomes. That experience deeply influenced how he approaches technology: as something that must be accurate, transparent, and built in service of human lives—not abstraction.
Growing up with limited financial resources, Chris saw firsthand how a lack of access to information, tools, and guidance can quietly shape a person’s future. Bridge exists to close that gap. The same skills Chris developed as a researcher—breaking down complex systems, validating data, and making informed decisions under uncertainty—now power Bridge’s mission to help users understand their finances, avoid costly mistakes, and build toward long-term stability.
For Chris, Bridge isn’t just a product—it’s a commitment to equity through clarity.
