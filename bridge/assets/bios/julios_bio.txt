Julio began his career at Bank of America as a Relationship Manager, where he gained firsthand exposure to banking products and a clear view of the financial struggles many people face every day. That realization set his direction.
In this role, he helped clients adopt mobile banking and optimize their financial accounts, but it became obvious that true financial health was impossible within the constraints of a single institution.
He later moved into a Financial Analyst role in distressed credit, where he was trusted to help manage millions of dollars. The work demanded absolute accountability, long hours, and precision, and it taught him how capital actually behaves under pressure.
While working in banking, Julio pursued a master’s degree in finance at Harvard University with an academic focus in data analytics, later pausing his career to study on campus. During this time, the path forward became obvious. He recognized he had the tools required to solve the problem he had already seen in practice. From that point foward, execution mattered more than credentials, and he intentionally graduated before completing a formal specialization.
He moved decisively to start Bridge. His mission is to tear down outdated financial barriers and replace slow, broken systems with smart technology that moves instantly and puts people, not institutions, in control of their money.
