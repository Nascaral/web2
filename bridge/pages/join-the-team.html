                            <p class="founder-role">Co-founder & CEO</p>
                            <p class="founder-bio">Julio began his career at Bank of America as a Relationship Manager, where he gained firsthand exposure to banking products and a clear view of the financial struggles many people face every day. That realization set his direction.
In this role, he helped clients adopt mobile banking and optimize their financial accounts, but it became obvious that true financial health was impossible within the constraints of a single institution.
He later moved into a Financial Analyst role in distressed credit, where he was trusted to help manage millions of dollars. The work demanded absolute accountability, long hours, and precision, and it taught him how capital actually behaves under pressure.
While working in banking, Julio pursued a master’s degree in finance at Harvard University with an academic focus in data analytics, later pausing his career to study on campus. During this time, the path forward became obvious. He recognized he had the tools required to solve the problem he had already seen in practice. From that point foward, execution mattered more than credentials, and he intentionally graduated before completing a formal specialization.
He moved decisively to start Bridge. His mission is to tear down outdated financial barriers and replace slow, broken systems with smart technology that moves instantly and puts people, not institutions, in control of their money.

                            <p class="founder-bio">Chris Tao is the COO and co-founder of Bridge, a financial technology company focused on giving everyday people access to the kinds of tools and clarity traditionally reserved for institutions and the wealthy. With over four years of experience as a Research Associate in the biotech industry, Chris brings a rigorous, data-driven mindset to product design—one shaped by precision, validation, and an unwavering responsibility to real people impacted by the work.
Before founding Bridge, Chris worked hands-on in laboratory and clinical environments supporting research tied to patient outcomes. That experience deeply influenced how he approaches technology: as something that must be accurate, transparent, and built in service of human lives—not abstraction.
Growing up with limited financial resources, Chris saw firsthand how a lack of access to information, tools, and guidance can quietly shape a person’s future. Bridge exists to close that gap. The same skills Chris developed as a researcher—breaking down complex systems, validating data, and making informed decisions under uncertainty—now power Bridge’s mission to help users understand their finances, avoid costly mistakes, and build toward long-term stability.
For Chris, Bridge isn’t just a product—it’s a commitment to equity through clarity.
